# üåç 25-Year Overview of Global Space Missions Dashboard

## üìå Overview  
This project presents a comprehensive Excel-based dashboard analyzing **25 years of global space missions**, including mission counts, success rates, technologies used, environmental impacts, and budgets across multiple countries. The dashboard provides valuable insights for aerospace analysts, government agencies, policy makers, and research institutions seeking to understand historical space exploration patterns.

## üéØ Project Objectives  
- Analyze the success rate trends across top spacefaring countries  
- Compare environmental impact and mission duration  
- Investigate technology adoption (e.g., traditional rockets, AI navigation)  
- Evaluate spending patterns and budget allocation per country  
- Identify changes in manned vs unmanned mission trends  
- Provide strategic recommendations for future investments in space programs

## üìä Dashboard Components, Observations & Recommendations

### 1. **Average Success Rate by Country**  
**Observation:** Germany leads all countries with the highest average success rate among the top seven spacefaring nations.  
**Recommendation:** Countries like UAE and UK should benchmark Germany‚Äôs mission planning and execution processes to enhance their reliability.

---

### 2. **Mission Count by Country**  
**Observation:** China and the UK have the highest number of missions, suggesting strong space agendas. Germany, while highly successful, has the least number of missions.  
**Recommendation:** Germany may benefit from scaling up mission volume while maintaining its high success standards.

---

### 3. **Mission Count by Technology Used**  
**Observation:** Traditional rockets remain the most widely used technology, followed by AI Navigation and Solar Propulsion.  
**Recommendation:** Encourage balanced investment across emerging propulsion technologies for enhanced sustainability and efficiency.

---

### 4. **Average Success Rate by Mission Type**  
**Observation:** Both manned and unmanned missions have a 50% average success rate, suggesting parity in performance.  
**Recommendation:** Further research is needed to explore underlying factors affecting both mission types, especially in high-stakes manned programs.

---

### 5. **Mission Trends Over Time**  
**Observation:** Manned missions showed fluctuation across years but remained relatively stable. Unmanned missions peaked around 2011‚Äì2012, then declined slightly.  
**Recommendation:** Agencies should investigate factors behind the decline and consider revitalizing interest in autonomous mission capabilities.

---

### 6. **Average Duration by Environmental Impact**  
**Observation:** High-impact missions lasted the longest on average (188 days), followed by low (181) and medium (176).  
**Recommendation:** Invest in green technologies to reduce the environmental cost of long-duration missions.

---

### 7. **Average Budget per Country**  
**Observation:** China spends the most on missions, followed closely by the UK and France. Germany, despite its success, allocates the lowest budget.  
**Recommendation:** Conduct efficiency studies to replicate Germany‚Äôs cost-effective strategies without compromising outcomes.

## üß† Summary of Key Insights  
- Germany is the most successful country, despite the lowest spend  
- China and UK dominate in mission volume  
- Traditional Rockets are still the go-to technology globally  
- High-impact missions are longer on average and require efficiency innovation  
- Budget does not always correlate with success‚Äîquality execution matters more
